# Grandma Radio

A radio player for my grandma, she has vision problems and TuneIn is not an option.

## Goals

* Easy interface for old people, big buttons and vibration feedback.
* Remote playlist configuration.

## Installation

```
$ git clone git@github.com:cherta/GrandmaRadio.gi
$ cd GrandmaRadio && yarn
$ react-native run-android
```

## Not interested in

* iOS version
* Beautiful and distracting UI
